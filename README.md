# PDFGen

**PDFGen** is a simple Python application designed for Windows that generates a PDF file from images in a specified directory. The images can be in `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` formats, and the generated PDF file will be named based on a `.fig` file located in the same directory. 

PDFGen v0.1 includes basic functionality for image processing and PDF generation.

## Features

- **Image Format Selection:** Users can specify which image formats (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png`) to include in the PDF generation.
- **Subfolder Inclusion:** Users can choose whether to include images from subdirectories.
- **Automatic PDF Naming:** The application automatically names the generated PDF file based on the name of the `.fig` file found in the specified directory.
- **Page Labeling:** Each page in the generated PDF includes a label at the bottom with the image filename, providing clear identification of each image.
